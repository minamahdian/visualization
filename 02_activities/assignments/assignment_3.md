# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.

- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
I used python to plot the heatmap. 
    > Who is your intended audience? 
    My intended audience is researchers 
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    I would like to find correlation analysis between different datasets. 
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    I ensured my visualization was easy to interpret by selecting appropriate colors, labels, and a clean layout. I applied this by using a high-contrast color( yellow and purple) scheme and ensuring text elements were legible without cluttering the plot. I considered colorblind-friendly palettes and readable fonts to ensure that the visualization was inclusive for all audiences. I used a heatmap to compare correlation between differernt features. I balanced spacing and proportions so that key patterns and relationships in the data were visible.

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    I made sure my data visualizations are reproducible by documenting every step of the process, using standardized tools, and maintaining clear version control. I used open-source software such as Python with Matplotlib/Seaborn  so others can replicate my workflow.I included scripts or code snippets to regenerate the visuals, ensuring anyone with the same data and environment can reproduce them. If I used a proprietary or non-reproducible tool, it could limit others from recreating my visualization. This would impact reproducibility because adjustments or modifications to the visualization might be difficult without access to the same software.Long-term accessibility could be a concern if the tool becomes obsolete or loses support.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    Ensuring accessibility in data visualization is key to making sure diverse audiences can interpret and engage with the information effectively. Hereâ€™s how I approached accessibility:
    1. Color Considerations: I used colorblind-friendly palettes to prevent misinterpretation by individuals with color vision deficiencies. 
    2. Clear Text & Labels: I ensured that all text, titles, and axis labels were legible by choosing appropriate font sizes and avoiding overly stylized fonts. I also provided direct annotations where necessary instead of relying only on legends.
    3. Alternative Formats: To support different accessibility needs, I included descriptive captions or text summaries explaining key insights from the visualization. This helps those who rely on screen readers or prefer text-based interpretations.
    4. Proper Scaling & Readability: I maintained an appropriate aspect ratio and spacing so that visual elements werenâ€™t overcrowded or distorted, ensuring clarity across different devices and screen sizes.
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization? 
    These are the people or groups including journalists, researchers, or policymakers  who will directly engage with the visualization.
    
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    Before I visuliaxe the data set I print the features to find the categorical and numericla data. I realized that most of the featues are numeric so I was curius if there is any correlation between different featues of the dataset. Two coloumns of the dataset were similar with different units which were basically the same.  I decided to choose three features which were

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
