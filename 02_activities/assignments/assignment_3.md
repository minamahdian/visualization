# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
The data source: https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/aggregated-ontario-greenhouse-vegetable-production/resource/ab6ecf23-e711-48c8-ba61-5cae07a3dc3f.

Figures 3: The Change in harvested area and vegtabel area from 1994-2024 in Ontario. 
This plot shows the harvested area and price of vegetables in Ontario from 1994 to 2024. Data for harvested area is unavailable from 1994 to 2006, but from 2007 onward, there has been a general increase in harvested area. Vegetable prices peaked in 1995 and 1999, while 2009 recorded the lowest price during the observed period.

- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
I used python to plot the heatmap. 
    > Who is your intended audience? 
    My intended audience is researchers 
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
   I aim to perform a correlation analysis to explore relationships between different features in the dataset.  
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    I ensured my visualization was easy to interpret by selecting appropriate colors, labels, and a clean layout. I applied this by using a high-contrast color( yellow and purple) scheme and ensuring text elements were legible without cluttering the plot. I considered colorblind-friendly palettes and readable fonts to ensure that the visualization was inclusive for all audiences. I used a heatmap to compare correlation between differernt features. I balanced spacing and proportions so that key patterns and relationships in the data were visible.

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    I made sure my data visualizations are reproducible by documenting every step of the process, using standardized tools, and maintaining clear version control. I used open-source software such as Python with Matplotlib/Seaborn  so others can replicate my workflow.I included scripts or code snippets to regenerate the visuals, ensuring anyone with the same data and environment can reproduce them. If I used a proprietary or non-reproducible tool, it could limit others from recreating my visualization. This would impact reproducibility because adjustments or modifications to the visualization might be difficult without access to the same software.Long-term accessibility could be a concern if the tool becomes obsolete or loses support.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    Ensuring accessibility in data visualization is key to making sure diverse audiences can interpret and engage with the information effectively. Hereâ€™s how I approached accessibility:
    1. Color Considerations: I used colorblind-friendly palettes to prevent misinterpretation by individuals with color vision deficiencies. 
    2. Clear Text & Labels: I ensured that all text, titles, and axis labels were legible by choosing appropriate font sizes and avoiding overly stylized fonts. I also provided direct annotations where necessary instead of relying only on legends.
    3. Alternative Formats: To support different accessibility needs, I included descriptive captions or text summaries explaining key insights from the visualization. This helps those who rely on screen readers or prefer text-based interpretations.
    4. Proper Scaling & Readability: I maintained an appropriate aspect ratio and spacing so that visual elements werenâ€™t overcrowded or distorted, ensuring clarity across different devices and screen sizes.
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization? 
    These are the people or groups including journalists, researchers, or policymakers  who will directly engage with the visualization.
    
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
     Before visualizing the dataset, I printed the features to identify which ones were categorical and which were numerical. I observed that most features were numerical, which led me to explore potential correlations among them. I also noticed that two columns represented essentially the same data but in different units. To analyze meaningful relationships, I selected three features: Harvested Area (ftÂ²), Production (tonnes), and Price ($/tonne), and proceeded to visualize the correlations between them.

    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?

     I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify variable types and understand their distributions. This included data cleaning tasks such as removing commas from numerical values and renaming feature titles to eliminate excessive spacing. I then performed correlation analysis to identify and select the most relevant featuresâ€”Harvested Area, Production, and Priceâ€”and created a new DataFrame containing only these variables. Finally, I dedicated significant effort to formatting the visualization for clarity, including setting axis labels, applying appropriate color schemes, and adjusting scales to enhance interpretability.

import pandas as pd

# If the file is in the same folder:
df = pd.read_csv("/Users/minamahdian/Desktop/Documents/DSI folder /visualization/data1.csv")

# Show the first few rows
df.head()

# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame

# Clean data set: Replace commas in numeric columns and convert to numeric
for column in df.columns:
    # Check if the column dtype is object (likely string) before applying .str
    if df[column].dtype == object:
        df[column] = pd.to_numeric(df[column].str.replace(',', ''), errors='coerce')
    else:
        # If not an object dtype, try converting directly to numeric
        df[column] = pd.to_numeric(df[column], errors='coerce')

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df.corr()

# Create the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()

# Create an annotated heatmap
plt.figure(figsize = (10,8))
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 12})
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, cmap = 'viridis', vmin = -1, vmax = 1, center = 0, annot=True, fmt=".2f", square=True, linewidths=.5)
plt.show()

# Edit the name of the coloumn 

df.rename(columns={"Harvested     Area       (square feet)": "HarvestedArea(ft2)", "Production (tonnes)": "Production (tonnes)","Average  Price         ($/tonne)":"Price($/tonne)","Harvested     Area       (acres)":"Harvested area (acres)"}, inplace=True)
